1. Its used to designate what the class will return.
2. SortedList stores this data type because it allows for the usage of the abstractList class and allows the user to use any data type they want in the list.
3. All of the list types are required to have an add(E obj) method, otherwise you cant add item to the list.
4. It will preform the same action for each list type that uses it, no matter the data type.
5. It would make sense to use a sorted list if you wanted to sort a set of name alphabetically, rather than randomly. It would be better to use an unsorted list if you wanted to fill it with numbers and pick one randomly.
6. Its better to use the E data type rather than the Object data type because you may create your own data type that stores items NOT based off the Object type.
7. I would create a concrete method in the AbstractList class and have it search the list for the obj you wasnt removed and return true of successful otherwise return false.
